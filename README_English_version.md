## üíº Projects:

üíº **Full Stack Developer Intern at AIRBUS via ALTEN ‚Äì Toulouse**  
üìÖ **February ‚Äì August 2024 (6 months)**  

### ‚úàÔ∏è **Project: Skywise Fleet Performance - Alten for Airbus**  
- **Client:** Alten, Airbus  
- **Technologies:** Java, React, AWS (S3, Lambda), Elasticsearch, Cucumber, Jenkins  
- **Role:** Full stack developer  
- Project on an application concerning aircraft maintenance:  
  Front-end and back-end development (Java and React):  
  implementation of a voting system and a ranking algorithm for user feedback

### **Objectives:**  
The Skywise Fleet Performance application allows airlines to monitor, in real-time, the faults and issues occurring on board aircraft during flights,  
so as to anticipate necessary repairs and avoid delays.

My project involved creating a comments feature and a voting system to ensure reliable user feedback.  
The main goal was to allow users to validate or refute feedback from their peers, particularly to identify recurring false alarms.

- **Architectural study**  
- **Implementation of the ability to vote on comments** (back-end and front-end)  
- **Development of a ranking algorithm** to prioritize comments based on their relevance  
- **Implementation of a rigorous testing policy** to ensure system robustness.

### **Methods used:**  
- **Methodology:** SAFe Agile Framework  
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS (S3, Lambda)  
- **Organization:**  
  - **Product Owner:** Responsible for the client‚Äôs specific requirements.  
  - **UI/UX Designer:** In charge of integrating the new voting feature into the React interface.  
  - **Indian IT Architect:** Responsible for the architecture of Skywise Fleet Performance.  
  - **Indian front-end and back-end developers:** In charge of the feedback feature.  
  - **Scrum Master:** Management of the schedule for several applications, including Skywise Fleet Performance.  
  - **Project Manager:** Coordination of the Alten team for Airbus.  
  - **My team (Team 42):** Technical assistance (AWS specialists).

In this project, I was the **sole Full Stack Developer**, and I had to rely on the previous work done by the Indian architects and developers.

We used **Google Meet** and **Gchat** to communicate with the team, including engineers in India.  
I participated in both **front-end** and **back-end** tasks, while specification, architecture, and UI/UX design were not my direct responsibility.

### **Achievements:**  
- **Implementation of a voting system** for user comments.  
- **Development in Java, React.js, integration with AWS Lambda and Elasticsearch.**  
- **Establishment of a unit and automated testing policy** with Jenkins, JUnit, Cucumber, Jest, Sonar.  
- **Analysis and resolution of recurring false alarms** through a comment and voting system.  
- **Contribution to improving the reliability of user feedback** by developing a ranking algorithm.
